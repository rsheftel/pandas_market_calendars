3.0 (8/17/21)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  behavior in some cases, so a new major version is warranted. For more discussion on the topic refer to
  `PR #142 <https://github.com/rsheftel/pandas_market_calendars/pull/142>`_ and
  `Issue #138 <https://github.com/rsheftel/pandas_market_calendars/issues/138>`_

2.0 (5/8/21)
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This version replaces the trading_calendars integration with exchange_calendars, closing out #120. `exchange_calendars <https://github.com/gerrymanoim/exchange_calendars>`_
if the fork of trading_calendars that is currently actively maintained. trading_calendars is now abandoned because
it's corporate sponsor is out of business and gone.

1.7 (5/6/21)
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This version eliminated the generic CMEExchangeCalendar. This calendar did not represent a specific market and thus
was not appropriate for any use. With the addition of the specific calendars for product types this is no longer
needed and is removed. To see the product specific calendars here: https://pandas-market-calendars.readthedocs.io/en/latest/calendars.html#futures-calendars

For the CMEEquityExchangeCalendar, this no longer is a mirror of the NYSE calendar as some of the holidays for the NYSE
are an open day with early close for CME. This calendar now has its own set of holiday assumptions. This may cause
some holidays missing until this calendar is fully tested and vetted.
